Setup instructions:

1. Download the following zip: “open_manipulator_save_and_load-master”
2. Extract the package into the main “src” folder
3. In the command terminal, type:

$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make

4. Edit the node, “save_and_load.py” to suit the upgraded version for the OM system; hints to be given by lecturer


Command Execution Instructions (to test python script):
1. Launch the world in Gazebo

$ roslaunch open_manipulator_gazebo open_manipulator_gazebo.launch

2. Press play and on another terminal, activate the controller

$ roslaunch open_manipulator_controller open_manipulator_controller.launch use_platform:=false

3. Begin Hand Guiding
(a) Execute "save_and_load launch" file

$ roslaunch open_manipulator_save_and_load save_and_load.launch

*ensure you have edited the original file first!
*ensure you have given permissions to your python file (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x save_and_load.py)

(b) A menu will appear in your terminal as below:
```
You can select the below menu by the keyboard input.  
---------------------------
1. Start to save joint data
2. Stop to save joint data
3. Load to joint data
---------------------------

(c) Since you cant use your hand to guide the OM in Gazebo, use teleop manual control instead. In new terminal, type command:

$ roslaunch open_manipulator_teleop open_manipulator_teleop_keyboard.launch

(d) Go back to terminal that you ran your save_and_load launch command (make sure you click on it first). When ready, type “1” and the programme starts recording the movements of the OM

(e) Go back to the “teleop” terminal, and move the OM in Gazebo using your keyboard. When done .....

(f) Go back to the “save_and_load” terminal, and type “2” to stop the recording and to save the records into a file in the cfg folder

(g) To command the OM to perform the recorded tasks, at the “save_and_load” terminal, type “3”. Observe that the OM will move by itself by loading the recorded file (i.e. the trajectories/actions that you teach the OM)
