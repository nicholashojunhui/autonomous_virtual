Configuration of Robot Export in bash

Since we are only dealing with TB3 waffle pi, lets configure all exports of the TB3 model to waffle_pi. This will help us save time in typing export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi

1. Type in Terminal:

$ gedit ~/.bashrc

2. Scroll all the way down and type “export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi” at the last line.

3. After which, save and exit. Type the command in the terminal:

$ source ~/.bashrc
