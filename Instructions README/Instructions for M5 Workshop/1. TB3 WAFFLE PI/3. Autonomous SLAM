For Virtual SLAM (one TB3), 4 Steps:

Step 1 - Launch Gazebo in TurtleBot3 World

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

Step 2b - Launch SLAM in a new terminal

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=frontier_exploration

*Note that if your frontier_exploration module don’t work, close all terminals, install it in a new terminal:
- $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-frontier-exploration ros-kinetic-navigation-stage
- Restart from Step 1

Step 3b - Activate Autonomous SLAM

• Click on “Publish Point” button and click the points (you have to click the button for each point) on the map to indicate what is the area of exploration you want the robot to explore

• After closing the boundary box, click on “Publish Point” button and indicate anywhere within the boundary box (preferably in front of the robot) for the robot to start exploring at


Step 4 - Save the Map once Completed in a new terminal:

$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/TB3_WORLD
