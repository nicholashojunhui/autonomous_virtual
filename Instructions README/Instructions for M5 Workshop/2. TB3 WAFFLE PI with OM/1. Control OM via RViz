Step 1 - Launch TurtleBot3 with OM in Gazebo's empty_world

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_gazebo turtlebot3_manipulation_gazebo.launch

Step 2 - Press play in Gazebo. Then in a new terminal, activate the move_group node by typing the command to use the Moveit feature:

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_moveit_config move_group.launch

If the node is launched successfully, the following message will be printed in the terminal: “You can start planning now!”

***Important: you must run both Gazebo and move_group nodes first before you can control the OM on the TB3

Step 3 - In a new terminal, type the command:

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch

*Once the RViz is fully loaded, you can control the mounted OM using the Interactive Markers

Step 4 - Under MotionPlanning, click on the “Planning” Tab

Step 5 - Move the Interactive Markers to shift the arm to your desired position

Step 6 - Click “Plan and Execute” to move the arm. You may observe the movements of the OM in Gazebo
