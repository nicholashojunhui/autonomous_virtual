Step 1 - Launch TurtleBot3 with OM in Gazebo's empty_world

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_gazebo turtlebot3_manipulation_gazebo.launch

Step 2 - Press play in Gazebo. Then in a new terminal, activate the move_group node by typing the command to use the Moveit feature:

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_moveit_config move_group.launch

If the node is launched successfully, the following message will be printed in the terminal: “You can start planning now!”

***Important: you must run both Gazebo and move_group nodes first before you can control the OM on the TB3

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_gui turtlebot3_manipulation_gui.launch

*Once the GUI is fully loaded, you can control the mounted OM using the GUI panel
