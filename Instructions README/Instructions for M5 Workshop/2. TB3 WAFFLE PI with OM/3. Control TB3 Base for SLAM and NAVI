[Setup]:

Firstly, navigate to the following directory:
/home/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3_manipulation_simulations/turtlebot3_manipulation_gazebo/launch

Copy and paste the given file in this folder:
TB3_with_OM.launch

This edited launch file allows you to use the TB3 world as your map in Gazebo for the TB3 with OM robot. 

*Note that you may copy and paste this launch file in your autonomous package too (under launch folder). However, the command to launch the file will be slightly different (i.e. roslaunch autonomous TB3_with_OM.launch instead of the below commands)



[SLAM] Steps are same as TB3 without arm but commands differ slightly (you may skip this):

Step 1 - Launch the TB3 with arm in the TB3 World map in Gazebo

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_gazebo TB3_with_OM.launch

OR $ roslaunch autonomous TB3_with_OM.launch (if you put in autonomous package)

Step 2 - Click Play button

Step 3 - Launch RViz SLAM app in new terminal

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_slam slam.launch

Step 4 – Launch teleop node in a new terminal:

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

Step 5 – Use the keys to make the TB3 explore the area to capture data on the map

Step 6 - Save the Map once Completed in a new terminal:

$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/TB3_WORLD



[NAVIGATION] Steps are same as TB3 without arm but commands differ slightly (you may skip this):

Step 1 - Launch Gazebo in TB3 World

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_gazebo TB3_with_OM.launch

Step 2 - Click Play button

Step 3 - Execute Controlled Navigation in a new terminal

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_navigation navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/TB3_WORLD.yaml

Step 4 - Click on “2D Pose Estimate” and set the correct initial position for the TB3 with arm

Step 5 - Click on “2D NAV Goal” and set the target destination for the TB3 with arm
