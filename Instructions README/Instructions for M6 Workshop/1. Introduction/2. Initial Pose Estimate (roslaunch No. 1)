[Initial pose estimate] (Using roslaunch to reduce steps):

1. Open terminal and type:

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

2. Copy and paste given launch files in your “autonomous” package (i.e. initial_pose.launch, initial_pose2.launch); you may create a launch folder to place all your launch files

3. Open new terminal and type:

$ roslaunch autonomous initial_pose.launch map_file:=$HOME/TB3_WORLD.yaml

*Ensure you still have the map that you have saved previously in the HOME directory

4. Observe in the RViz application that the TB3’s pose estimate will be automatically executed
