For this sub-project, you are required to write 1 Python files and 1 launch file with the
following details:

1. Project4a.launch
2. P4_path_planning.py

*Use turtlebot3_world map for Project 4a

Objective:

(A) The launch file when executed will open the RViz, then run the initial pose node (i.e. initial_pose.py), which enables the TB3 to first initiate the pose estimate for you

(B) And lastly, run the path planning node (i.e. P4_path_planning.py), which enables the TB3 to follow the desired path; the desired path is illustrated in the slides
